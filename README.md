# TODO
## Code
* idle should animate "pulse" occasionally
* Is 5 seconds too short for real-life human interaction? should be more like 30 seconds?
* bring back `MaxAnimation` to limit power draw
* Split thresholds into "low interactivity", "med interactivity" (color shifts), and "max interactivity" (`MaxAnimation`)
* should color transition for fewer than max interactions?
